**<h1>Lecture0. Introduction and Overview</h1>**

<h2> 1.1  Audience </h2>

    1. y= Wx + b (y = ax+b) <br>
       This is a lecture that can be fully followed by understanding this concept. <br>
       Because there are many machine learning algorithm tools. <br>
    2. Like black-box ( you don't know what's in there ),  you can input and output.<br>
    3. There is a Tensorflow tool that can be implemented. <br>
<hr/>
 <h2> 1.2  Goals</h2>
 
    1. Basic understanding of machine running
    2. Basic algorithm learning for Deep Learning
     - Linear revision, Logistic revision. 
     - Neural networks. Convolutional Neural networks
    3. Use Tensorflow to actually solve problems 
<hr/>
 <h2> 1.3  Course Structure </h2>
 
    1. Lecture 10-minute lecture
    2. Programming using Tensorflow
<hr/>
 <h2> 1.4  Schedule</h2> 
 
    1. Machine learning basic concepts
    2. Linear regression
    3. Logisitic regression (classification)
    4. Multivariable (Vector) linear/logisitic regression
    5. Neural networks
    6. Deep learning (CNN, RNN, Bidirectional Neural networks)
