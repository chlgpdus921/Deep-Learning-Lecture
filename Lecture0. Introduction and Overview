Lecture0. Introduction and Overview

< Audience >
1. y= Wx + b (y = ax+b) 
This is a lecture that can be fully followed by understanding this concept. 
Because there are many machine learning algorithm tools. 
2. Like black-box ( you don't know what's in there ),  you can input and output.
3. There is a Tensorflow tool that can be implemented. 

< Goals >
1. Basic understanding of machine running
2. Basic algorithm learning for Deep Learning
   - Linear revision, Logistic revision. 
   - Neural networks. Convolutional Neural networks
3. Use Tensorflow to actually solve problems 

< Course Structure >
1. Lecture 10-minute lecture
2. Programming using Tensorflow

< Schedule >
1. Machine learning basic concepts
2. Linear regression
3. Logisitic regression (classification)
4. Multivariable (Vector) linear/logisitic regression
5. Neural networks
6. Deep learning (CNN, RNN, Bidirectional Neural networks)
